# Setup Notes

## Environment Setup Complete ✅

The project environment has been successfully set up with the following components:

### Installed Packages
- ✅ **transformers** - Core Hugging Face library
- ✅ **torch** - PyTorch 2.2.2 with MPS (Apple Silicon) support
- ✅ **datasets** - Hugging Face datasets library
- ✅ **diffusers** - Updated to 0.31.0 for compatibility
- ✅ **peft** - Parameter-efficient fine-tuning
- ✅ **sentencepiece** - Tokenizer support
- ✅ **accelerate** - Training acceleration
- ⚠️ **bitsandbytes** - Installed but limited on macOS (CUDA-only features)

### Known Issues & Solutions

1. **sentencepiece build failure**: Resolved by installing via pip instead of poetry
2. **diffusers compatibility**: Fixed by updating to version 0.31.0
3. **bitsandbytes on macOS**: Limited functionality (no 8-bit quantization) - this is expected

### Running the Tutorial Notebook

To run the tutorial notebook:

```bash
# Activate the environment
poetry shell

# Or run directly with poetry
poetry run jupyter notebook notebooks/tutorial.ipynb
```

### Testing the Environment

Run the test script to verify everything is working:

```bash
poetry run python test_environment.py
```

### Device Support
- **macOS (Apple Silicon)**: Uses MPS device for GPU acceleration
- **Linux/Windows with NVIDIA GPU**: Would use CUDA
- **CPU**: Fallback option for all platforms

## Next Steps

1. Run the tutorial notebook to explore all Chapter 8 examples
2. Check out the demonstration scripts in `src/`
3. Read the improved documentation in `docs/art_08i.md`
