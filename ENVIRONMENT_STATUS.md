# Environment Setup Status âœ…

## Setup Completed Successfully!

The Hugging Face workflows environment has been successfully configured and tested.

### What was fixed:
1. **sentencepiece** - Installed via pip to avoid build issues on macOS ARM64
2. **diffusers** - Updated to v0.31.0 for compatibility with latest huggingface-hub
3. **Import paths** - Fixed relative imports in all demonstration modules
4. **Pipeline registration** - Updated for newer transformers API

### Verified Components:
- âœ… Basic pipeline functionality
- âœ… Sentiment analysis
- âœ… MPS (Apple Silicon) GPU support
- âœ… All core libraries imported successfully

### Running Examples:

1. **Test the environment:**
   ```bash
   poetry run python test_environment.py
   ```

2. **Run simple demo:**
   ```bash
   poetry run python test_demo.py
   ```

3. **Launch tutorial notebook:**
   ```bash
   poetry run jupyter notebook notebooks/tutorial.ipynb
   ```

4. **Run individual demos:**
   ```bash
   poetry run python src/custom_pipelines.py
   poetry run python src/efficient_data_handling.py
   poetry run python src/optimization_demo.py
   ```

### Notes:
- The environment uses MPS (Metal Performance Shaders) for GPU acceleration on Apple Silicon
- bitsandbytes has limited functionality on macOS (no INT8 quantization)
- All examples have been adapted to work with the current library versions

The setup is complete and ready for use! ðŸŽ‰
