## Environment Setup

Before diving into custom pipelines, you'll establish a robust development environment. This foundation ensures smooth workflow development and consistent results across different machines.

### Poetry Setup (Recommended for Projects)

Poetry provides dependency isolation and version locking—critical for reproducible ML workflows. Here's how to set up your environment:

```bash
# Install poetry if not already installed
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

# Create new project
poetry new huggingface-workflows
cd huggingface-workflows

# Add dependencies with flexible versioning
poetry add "transformers>=4.40.0,<5.0.0" torch torchvision torchaudio
poetry add "datasets>=2.14.0" diffusers accelerate sentencepiece
poetry add pillow soundfile bitsandbytes
poetry add --group dev jupyter ipykernel matplotlib

# Activate environment
poetry shell
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
- Poetry installation provides isolated package management
- Project creation establishes clean workspace structure
- Flexible versioning (e.g., `>=4.40.0,<5.0.0`) allows minor updates while preventing breaking changes
- Development dependencies (`--group dev`) separate production from exploration tools
- Shell activation ensures all commands use the correct environment

### Mini-conda Setup (Alternative)

For teams preferring conda's binary package management, this setup provides similar isolation:

```bash
# Download and install mini-conda from https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

# Create environment with Python 3.12.9
conda create -n huggingface-workflows python=3.12.9
conda activate huggingface-workflows

# Install packages
conda install -c pytorch -c huggingface transformers torch torchvision torchaudio
conda install -c conda-forge datasets diffusers accelerate pillow soundfile matplotlib
pip install sentencepiece bitsandbytes
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
- Conda environments provide complete Python isolation
- Channel specification (`-c pytorch`) ensures compatible binaries
- Mixed conda/pip installation handles packages not available in conda
- Python 3.12.9 provides latest stable features and performance

### Traditional pip with pyenv

For lightweight setups or CI/CD pipelines, pyenv with pip offers flexibility:

```bash
# Install pyenv (macOS/Linux)
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
# Configure shell (add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc)
export PATH="$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"

# Install Python 3.12.9 with pyenv
pyenv install 3.12.9
pyenv local 3.12.9

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install packages with flexible versioning
pip install "transformers>=4.40.0,<5.0.0" torch torchvision torchaudio
pip install "datasets>=2.14.0" diffusers accelerate sentencepiece
pip install pillow soundfile bitsandbytes jupyter matplotlib
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
- Pyenv manages multiple Python versions without system conflicts
- Local Python version (`.python-version` file) ensures consistency
- Virtual environment isolation prevents package conflicts
- Flexible versioning protects against breaking changes

## Introduction: From Magic Pipelines to Master Chef—Why Custom Data Workflows Matter

Picture Hugging Face pipelines as meal kits: quick, convenient, perfect for a fast start. **Drop in. Run. Done.** But what happens when your customers have allergies? When the recipe doesn't scale to a hundred guests? When you need that secret sauce only you know how to make?

This chapter transforms you from pipeline user to workflow architect. You'll peek inside Hugging Face pipelines, swap components, and design data workflows that handle scale, complexity, and real business needs.

Let's explore how pipelines make things easy—and where their limits begin.

### Quick Start: Hugging Face Pipeline (2025 Best Practice)

The following code demonstrates modern pipeline initialization with explicit configuration for reproducibility:

```python
# Modern quick-start with explicit model and device
from transformers import pipeline

# Specify model checkpoint and device for reproducibility
clf = pipeline(
    'sentiment-analysis',
    model='distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english',
    device=0  # 0 for CUDA GPU, -1 for CPU, 'mps' for Apple Silicon
)

# Run prediction on text
result = clf('I love Hugging Face!')
print(result)
# Output: [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9998}]

# Check model card: https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
- Pipeline initialization downloads and caches the model automatically
- Explicit model specification ensures consistent results across runs
- Device parameter controls hardware acceleration (GPU/CPU/MPS)
- Single function call handles tokenization, inference, and result formatting
- Model card URL provides training details and limitations

**Magic!** This single command downloads a pre-trained model, loads the tokenizer, and formats your data. Instant results—no deep setup required. By specifying model and device, you ensure reproducibility.

But out-of-the-box pipelines crumble when you need:
- Custom data cleaning (HTML, emojis, multilingual text)
- Chained models (sentiment + entity recognition)  
- Speed optimization (batching, device placement)
- Business logic (filtering, compliance checks)
- Scale (streaming, batch processing)

Ever felt like a chef stuck with meal kits when you need to cater a wedding?

Here's a real scenario: Your retail chain processes customer reviews from multiple platforms. Standard pipelines work for demos but fail when you need to:
- Clean data from Twitter, Amazon, and internal systems
- Add product metadata
- Process 10,000 reviews per minute
- Log for compliance
- Stream from S3 buckets

**Without custom workflows? Bottlenecks. Errors. Missed SLAs.**

### Custom Preprocessing Before Inference

The next example shows how to add preprocessing logic while maintaining pipeline simplicity:

```python
def custom_preprocess(text):
    # Normalize text for consistent predictions
    import string
    text = text.lower()
    return text.translate(str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation))

texts = ["Wow! Amazing product!!!", "I don't like this..."]

# Clean then predict
cleaned = [custom_preprocess(t) for t in texts]
results = clf(cleaned, batch_size=16)  # Batch for speed!
print(results)
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. Define preprocessing (lowercase, strip punctuation)
2. Clean inputs before pipeline processing
3. Use `batch_size` for 5x faster inference
4. Get reliable predictions on normalized data

For production systems, you'll want preprocessing embedded directly into the pipeline:

### Advanced: Pipeline Subclassing

This approach creates reusable, production-ready pipelines with built-in preprocessing:

```python
from transformers import Pipeline

class CustomSentimentPipeline(Pipeline):
    def preprocess(self, inputs):
        # Strip HTML, normalize text
        text = inputs.lower()
        import string
        text = text.translate(str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation))
        return super().preprocess(text)
    
    def postprocess(self, outputs):
        # Add confidence thresholds
        results = super().postprocess(outputs)
        for r in results:
            r['confident'] = r['score'] > 0.95
        return results
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
- `preprocess` method intercepts input before tokenization
- Text normalization ensures consistent model behavior
- `postprocess` method enhances output with business logic
- Confidence flag enables downstream filtering
- Inheritance preserves all pipeline functionality

### Streaming Large-Scale Data

When processing massive datasets, memory efficiency becomes critical:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

# Stream massive datasets without memory issues
dataset = load_dataset('csv', data_files='reviews.csv', 
                      split='train', streaming=True)

batch_size = 32
batch = []
for example in dataset:
    batch.append(custom_preprocess(example['text']))
    if len(batch) == batch_size:
        results = clf(batch, batch_size=batch_size)
        # Process results (save, log, etc.)
        batch = []
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
- Streaming mode loads data on-demand, not all at once
- Batch accumulation balances memory use and processing speed
- Results processing happens immediately, preventing memory buildup
- Empty batch reset prevents memory leaks
- Pattern scales to terabyte-sized datasets

**Key Takeaways:**
- Pipelines provide fast starts but limit production flexibility
- Always specify model + device for reproducibility
- Custom workflows handle real business requirements
- Batch processing can deliver 10x throughput improvements

## From Pipeline to Custom Components

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Pipeline {
        +model: PreTrainedModel
        +tokenizer: PreTrainedTokenizer  
        +processor: Processor
        +framework: str
        +device: torch.device
        +preprocess(inputs)
        +_forward(model_inputs)
        +postprocess(outputs)
        +__call__(inputs)
    }
    
    class Tokenizer {
        +vocab_size: int
        +model_max_length: int
        +encode(text)
        +decode(ids)
        +batch_encode_plus(texts)
    }
    
    class Model {
        +config: PretrainedConfig
        +num_parameters()
        +forward(input_ids)
        +to(device)
        +eval()
    }
    
    class Processor {
        +feature_extractor
        +tokenizer
        +__call__(inputs)
        +batch_decode(outputs)
    }
    
    Pipeline --> Tokenizer : uses
    Pipeline --> Model : uses
    Pipeline --> Processor : optional
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
- `Pipeline` orchestrates the complete inference workflow
- `Tokenizer` converts text to model-compatible token IDs
- `Model` performs actual neural network computation
- `Processor` handles multimodal inputs (images, audio)
- Arrows show dependency relationships between components

### Pipeline Components: Under the Hood

Think of pipelines as assembly lines. **Raw input → Predictions.** Three workers make it happen:

- **Tokenizer:** The translator. Converts "Hello world" → [101, 7592, 2088, 102]
- **Model:** The brain. Neural network processing tokens → predictions
- **Processor:** The prep cook. Resizes images, extracts audio features (multimodal tasks)

Let's inspect these components in action:

```python
from transformers import pipeline

clf = pipeline('text-classification')
print('Model:', clf.model)
print('Tokenizer:', clf.tokenizer)  
print('Processor:', getattr(clf, 'processor', None))
print('Framework:', clf.framework)  # pytorch or tensorflow
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
- Pipeline creation automatically selects compatible components
- Model inspection reveals architecture details
- Tokenizer check ensures vocabulary compatibility
- Processor presence indicates multimodal capabilities
- Framework detection helps with debugging

**Why inspect?** When predictions look wrong, check if model and tokenizer match. Transformers now warns about mismatches!

### Customizing Pipelines: Modern Approach

Real projects demand more than vanilla pipelines. As of Transformers 4.40+, customize via:

1. **Swap components**—Use custom models/tokenizers
2. **Compose pipelines**—Chain multiple tasks
3. **Register new types**—Create reusable workflows

Let's combine sentiment analysis + entity recognition:

```python
from transformers import Pipeline, pipeline
from transformers.pipelines import register_pipeline

class SentimentNERPipeline(Pipeline):
    def __init__(self, sentiment_pipeline, ner_pipeline, **kwargs):
        self.sentiment_pipeline = sentiment_pipeline
        self.ner_pipeline = ner_pipeline
        super().__init__(
            model=sentiment_pipeline.model,
            tokenizer=sentiment_pipeline.tokenizer,
            **kwargs
        )
    
    def _forward(self, inputs):
        sentiment = self.sentiment_pipeline(inputs)
        entities = self.ner_pipeline(inputs)
        return {"sentiment": sentiment, "entities": entities}

# Register for reuse
register_pipeline(
    task="sentiment-ner",
    pipeline_class=SentimentNERPipeline,
    pt_model=True
)

# Use it!
pipe = pipeline("sentiment-ner")
result = pipe("Apple Inc. makes amazing products!")
# {'sentiment': [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.99}],
#  'entities': [{'word': 'Apple Inc.', 'entity': 'ORG'}]}
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
- Custom pipeline class combines two existing pipelines
- `_forward` method orchestrates both models
- Registration makes pipeline reusable across projects
- Single call returns combined analysis
- Pattern extends to any pipeline combination

**Pro tip:** Composition beats inheritance. Build complex workflows from simple parts.

### Debugging Pipelines

When things break (they will), make errors visible:

```python
from transformers.utils import logging
logging.set_verbosity_debug()

# Now see EVERYTHING
clf = pipeline('text-classification')
result = clf('Debug me!')
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
- Debug logging exposes tokenization steps
- Model loading progress becomes visible
- Token-to-ID mapping appears in logs
- Inference timing helps identify bottlenecks

**Common issues:**
- Model/tokenizer mismatch → Check families match
- Wrong input format → Pipelines expect strings, lists, or dicts
- Memory errors → Reduce batch size or max_length
- Slow inference → Enable Flash Attention (GPU) or batch more

**Next:** Let's handle data at scale with 🤗 Datasets.

## Efficient Data Handling with 🤗 Datasets

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Raw Data Sources] --> B{Load Dataset}
    B -->|Small Data| C[In-Memory Dataset]
    B -->|Large Data| D[Streaming Dataset]
    
    C --> E[Transform with map]
    D --> F[Stream + Transform]
    
    E --> G[Filter Examples]
    F --> G
    
    G --> H[Batch Processing]
    H --> I[Model Inference]
    
    J[Version Control] -.->|lakeFS| C
    J -.->|Track Changes| E
    
    K[Annotation Tools] -->|Argilla| C
    K -->|Quality Labels| G
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
- Raw data flows through loading decision based on size
- Small datasets load entirely into memory for speed
- Large datasets stream to avoid memory limits
- Transformations apply via `map` operations
- Filtering removes unwanted examples
- Batch processing optimizes model inference
- Version control and annotation integrate seamlessly

Ever tried loading Wikipedia into pandas? **Memory explosion!** The 🤗 Datasets library handles millions of examples without breaking a sweat.

### Loading and Transforming Data

The Datasets library provides efficient data handling with automatic caching and memory mapping:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load IMDB reviews
dataset = load_dataset('imdb', split='train')
print(f"Dataset size: {len(dataset)}")  # 25,000 examples
print(dataset[0])  # {'text': '...', 'label': 1}

# Custom data? Easy!
custom = load_dataset('csv', data_files='reviews.csv')
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
- `load_dataset` downloads and caches data automatically
- Split specification loads only needed portions
- First access downloads; subsequent uses hit cache
- CSV loading works identically to hub datasets
- Memory mapping prevents RAM overflow

Transform data efficiently with parallel processing:

```python
def preprocess(batch):
    # Process entire batches at once
    batch['text'] = [text.lower() for text in batch['text']]
    batch['length'] = [len(text.split()) for text in batch['text']]
    return batch

# Transform with parallel processing
dataset = dataset.map(preprocess, batched=True, num_proc=4)

# Filter short reviews
dataset = dataset.filter(lambda x: x['length'] > 20)
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
- Batch processing operates on multiple examples simultaneously
- List comprehensions process entire columns efficiently
- Parallel processing (`num_proc=4`) uses multiple CPU cores
- Filtering creates view without copying data
- Chaining operations maintains memory efficiency

**Performance boost:** `batched=True` processes 100x faster than one-by-one!

### Streaming Massive Datasets

What about Wikipedia-scale data? **Stream it!**

```python
# Stream without loading everything
wiki = load_dataset('wikipedia', '20220301.en', 
                   split='train', streaming=True)

# Process as you go
for i, article in enumerate(wiki):
    if i >= 1000:  # Process first 1000
        break
    # Your processing here
    process_article(article['text'])
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
- `streaming=True` enables lazy loading
- Data loads only when accessed
- Enumeration provides progress tracking
- Early break prevents infinite processing
- Memory stays constant regardless of dataset size

**Memory usage:** 200MB instead of 100GB. **Magic? No. Smart engineering.**

### Modern Annotation Workflow

Great models need great labels. Here's a production-ready annotation pipeline:

```python
# Best practices for annotation
from datasets import Dataset

# 1. Start small - annotate 100 examples
pilot_data = dataset.select(range(100))

# 2. Use Argilla for team annotation
# See Article 12 for Argilla + HF integration

# 3. Version your annotations
# dataset.push_to_hub("company/product-reviews-v2")

# 4. Track changes with lakeFS for compliance
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
- Pilot annotation validates labeling guidelines
- Small batches prevent wasted effort
- Team tools ensure consistency
- Version control enables reproducibility
- Change tracking satisfies compliance requirements

**Remember:** Bad labels create bad models. Invest in quality annotation.

## Optimized Inference and Cost Management

    style C fill:#90EE90
    style K fill:#FFB6C1
    style M fill:#87CEEB
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
- Original model branches into three optimization paths
- Quantization reduces precision for smaller models
- Pruning removes unnecessary parameters
- Compilation optimizes for specific hardware
- Each technique targets different deployment scenarios
- Performance gains stack when combined

Deploying transformers resembles running a busy restaurant kitchen. **Speed matters. Costs matter more.**

### Batching for 10x Throughput

Single-item processing wastes computational resources. Batching transforms performance:

```python
# Slow: One by one
texts = ["Review 1", "Review 2", "Review 3"]
for text in texts:
    result = clf(text)  # 3 separate calls

# Fast: Batch processing
results = clf(texts, 
             padding=True,      # Align lengths
             truncation=True,   # Cap at max_length
             max_length=128)    # Prevent memory spikes
# 10x faster on GPU!
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
- Individual calls waste GPU parallelism
- Batching fills GPU compute units
- Padding ensures uniform tensor shapes
- Truncation prevents memory overflow
- Max length balances speed and accuracy

**Real numbers:** Single inference: 50ms. Batch of 32: 200ms. **That's 8x speedup!**

### Modern Quantization: Slash Costs Dramatically

Quantization reduces model precision while maintaining accuracy:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification

# Standard model: 400MB
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
    "bert-base-uncased"
)

# Quantized model: 100MB, 4x faster!
model_int8 = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
    "bert-base-uncased",
    load_in_8bit=True,
    device_map="auto"
)

# For LLMs: INT4 quantization
model_int4 = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf",
    load_in_4bit=True,
    bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=torch.float16
)
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
- INT8 quantization reduces memory by 75%
- `device_map="auto"` optimally distributes layers
- INT4 enables 7B parameter models on consumer GPUs
- Compute dtype maintains accuracy during forward pass
- Automatic mixed precision balances speed and quality

**Cost impact:** AWS inference costs drop 75% with INT8. **Same accuracy. Quarter the price.**

### Edge Deployment Strategy

Deploy models where compute happens—at the edge:

```python
# 1. Choose efficient model
model_name = "microsoft/MiniLM-L6-H256-uncased"  # 6x smaller than BERT

# 2. Quantize for edge
import torch
quantized = torch.quantization.quantize_dynamic(
    model, {torch.nn.Linear}, dtype=torch.qint8
)

# 3. Export to ONNX/GGUF
model.save_pretrained("model_mobile", push_to_hub=False)

# 4. Benchmark on target device
# iPhone 14: 15ms/inference
# Raspberry Pi: 100ms/inference
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
- Model selection prioritizes size over absolute accuracy
- Dynamic quantization adapts to input ranges
- Export formats enable cross-platform deployment
- Device-specific benchmarking ensures performance
- Edge inference eliminates network latency

**Real example:** Retail chain deploys MiniLM on 10,000 handheld scanners. Instant product search. No cloud costs.

### Advanced: PEFT for Large Models

Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning makes large models accessible:

```python
from peft import LoraConfig, get_peft_model, TaskType

# Adapt Llama-2 with 0.1% of parameters
peft_config = LoraConfig(
    task_type=TaskType.CAUSAL_LM,
    r=16,  # LoRA rank
    lora_alpha=32,
    lora_dropout=0.1,
    target_modules=["q_proj", "v_proj"]
)

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf")
peft_model = get_peft_model(model, peft_config)

# Only 40MB of trainable parameters instead of 13GB!
peft_model.print_trainable_parameters()
# trainable params: 4,194,304 || all params: 6,738,415,616 || trainable%: 0.06%
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
- LoRA adds small trainable matrices to frozen model
- Rank (`r=16`) controls capacity vs efficiency tradeoff
- Target modules focus updates on attention layers
- Dropout prevents overfitting on small datasets
- 0.06% trainable parameters enable consumer GPU training

**Impact:** Fine-tune Llama-2 on a single GPU. Deploy updates as small adapters. **Efficiency unlocked.**

## Synthetic Data Generation

    style F fill:#FFE4B5
    style G fill:#E6E6FA
    style H fill:#F0E68C
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
- Dataset analysis identifies gaps and issues
- Different problems require different generation approaches
- LLMs handle text, diffusion models create images
- Quality filters ensure synthetic data improves training
- Validation confirms synthetic data matches real distribution

Ever wished you had more training data? **Synthetic data is your genie.**

### Text Generation with Modern LLMs

Generate high-quality synthetic text using state-of-the-art models:

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Latest open LLM
gen = pipeline(
    'text-generation',
    model='mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2',
    device_map='auto'
)

# Generate product reviews
prompt = """Generate a realistic negative product review for headphones.
Include specific details about sound quality and comfort."""

reviews = gen(
    prompt,
    max_new_tokens=100,
    num_return_sequences=5,
    temperature=0.8  # More variety
)

# Quality check
for review in reviews:
    if is_realistic(review['generated_text']):
        dataset.add_item(review)
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
- Instruction-tuned models follow prompts precisely
- Specific details in prompts improve generation quality
- Temperature controls creativity vs consistency
- Multiple sequences provide variety
- Quality checking prevents model collapse

**Pro tip:** Always validate synthetic data. Bad synthetic data creates bad models.

### Image Generation with SDXL

Create training images for visual tasks:

```python
from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline
import torch

# Load latest Stable Diffusion
pipe = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(
    "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0",
    torch_dtype=torch.float16,
    variant="fp16"
)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

# Generate training images
prompts = [
    "smartphone with cracked screen, product photo",
    "laptop with coffee spill damage, repair documentation",
    "pristine condition vintage watch, auction listing"
]

for prompt in prompts:
    image = pipe(prompt, num_inference_steps=30).images[0]
    # Add to training set with appropriate labels
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
- SDXL provides photorealistic generation
- FP16 variant reduces memory usage
- Specific prompts create targeted training data
- Inference steps balance quality and speed
- Generated images augment rare classes

### Synthetic Data Validation

Quality control ensures synthetic data improves your model:

```python
def validate_synthetic_data(synthetic, real):
    """Ensure synthetic data improves dataset"""
    
    # 1. Statistical similarity
    real_stats = calculate_statistics(real)
    synth_stats = calculate_statistics(synthetic)
    assert similarity(real_stats, synth_stats) > 0.85
    
    # 2. Diversity check
    assert len(set(synthetic)) / len(synthetic) > 0.95
    
    # 3. Quality filters
    synthetic = filter_nsfw(synthetic)
    synthetic = filter_toxic(synthetic)
    
    # 4. Human review sample
    sample = random.sample(synthetic, 100)
    # Send sample for manual QA

    results = {}
    
    # Baseline
    baseline_model = load_model(model_name)
    results["baseline"] = benchmark_model(baseline_model)
    
    # Quantization techniques
    for technique in ["dynamic_int8", "static_int8", "int4_nf4"]:
        quantized = apply_quantization(baseline_model, technique)
        results[technique] = benchmark_model(quantized)
    
    # Batching optimization
    for batch_size in [1, 8, 32, 64]:
        results[f"batch_{batch_size}"] = benchmark_batching(
            baseline_model, batch_size

## Summary

This chapter transformed you from a pipeline user to a workflow architect. You learned to customize Hugging Face pipelines, handle data at massive scale with 🤗 Datasets, optimize models for 75% cost reduction, and generate high-quality synthetic data. These skills—from INT4 quantization to streaming datasets to PEFT methods—form the foundation of production-ready AI systems. You're now equipped to build efficient, scalable transformer solutions that handle real-world complexity.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Modify a standard Hugging Face pipeline to include a custom pre-processing function (e.g., lowercasing or removing stopwords) before inference.

**Hint:** Subclass the Pipeline class or use the 'preprocess' method to add your custom logic.

### Exercise 2: Load a large dataset from the Hugging Face Hub and apply a transformation using the map function. Measure the time and memory usage with and without streaming.

**Hint:** Use load_dataset with and without streaming=True; use Python's time and memory profiling tools.

### Exercise 3: Quantize a transformer model using PyTorch dynamic quantization and compare its inference speed and memory footprint to the original model.

**Hint:** Follow the quantization code example in the chapter and use timing/memory tools like timeit and torch.cuda.memory_allocated().

### Exercise 4: Generate synthetic text samples for a minority class in your dataset and use them to augment your training data. Evaluate the impact on model performance.

**Hint:** Use a text-generation pipeline to create new samples, retrain your model, and compare evaluation metrics before and after augmentation.

### Exercise 5: Debug a pipeline that produces unexpected outputs by enabling verbose logging and tracing the flow of data through each component.

**Hint:** Set logging to DEBUG, inspect log outputs, and check the configuration of your model, tokenizer, and pipeline arguments.
